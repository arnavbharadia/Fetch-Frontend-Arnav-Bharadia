## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnavbharadia/Fetch-Frontend-Arnav-Bharadia.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd dog-breed-gallery
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser:

   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

   Alternatively, you can simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default browser.

## Usage

Once you have the project open in your web browser, you will see a web page with the following features:

- A dropdown menu to select one or more dog breeds.
- A "Load Images" button to fetch and display images of the selected dog breeds.
- An image gallery where the images will be displayed in a masonry-style layout with hover effects.

## How It Works

The Dog Breed Gallery project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to perform the following tasks:

- Fetch a list of available dog breeds from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/).
- Allow users to select one or more dog breeds from a dropdown menu.
- Fetch random images of the selected dog breeds from the API.
- Display the fetched images in a responsive masonry-style grid layout.
- Add a hover effect to the images to make them slightly larger on mouseover.
